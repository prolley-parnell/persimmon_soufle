Welcome to the documentation for this repo.
This is a big explanation of every step I made to make a mechanical keyboard.

### Why a mechanical keyboard?
To be honest, there is such a fanatic community online you can step into at varying levels that I thought I would
never be short of inspiration. And for ergonomic split keyboards, it is cheaper to make them (_if you don't cover them 
in LEDs_). What does any chronically seated perpetual student research when they have a deadline due other than ergonomic equipment?

### Why are you writing it up?
Mainly because I said I would write something as a useful resource for students wanting to use the University of Edinburgh
Makerspace as thank you for all the help, materials, time and resources I was given while making this.

Thanks, Garry!

### Why now?
Well, I really wanted to enjoy robotics again. I have been a "Roboticist" for a decade, and it has always been for
academic reasons. Through A-Levels, Undergrad, and now a PhD, I have never followed through on robotics in my 
spare time because, quite frankly, I did not want to look at a screen in the evenings after doing it all day. I wanted
to go outside, juggle, go on walks, knit, or spin (the fibre or the circus variety), so I always kept robotics in the
work category. But now, reaching the end of the PhD I have reached a choice point, do I run away and open a bakery or become a
gardener like many burnt-out PhD students dream of doing, or do I try to find out why I started on this path in the first
place? I wanted to find a project I could take full ownership of, modify and personalise in my own way and use all my accumulated skills for fun.  

If you're still interested in the process, then read on. The story is told in a mostly chronological manner. It will have an endpoint where I stop updating the documentation and just make changes to the code itself as needed.
